# DatabaseDesignAndDevelopment
This repository contains work and programming done for the Database &amp; Design module which was part of the HDip in Software Development at GMIT.

## Project Brief

The aim of the project was to assess a student's ability to design and construct a databse that can be deployed in a commercial database management system. The initial phase of the project required the student to design a relational database for a given scenario (In this case a dental pratice). The buisness rules of the scenario had to be developed and implemented via the database schema and the as outlines below.

  1. Rational Schema
     * Tables
     * Attributes
     * Primary Keys 
     * Foreign Keys
  2. Test Data
  3. Queries
     * Select
     * Insert
     * Update
     * Delete
  4. Use the database created to demo Codds rules with respect to the created database. The first 10 rules MUST be demonstrated using SQL including an explanation.

## Submission

  1. The '2021_DDD_Project_G00388055_CoddsRules.pdf' contains the rational schema and all the associated tables, attribures, primary keys and foreign keys. 
  2. The '2021_DDD_g00388055_Database.sql' contain the code that creates the database which was created as part of the project and the associated test data.
  3. The '2021_DDD_Porject_g00388055_SQLScript.sql' file contains the queries for select, insert, update and delete.
  4. The '2021_DDD_Project_G00388055_CoddsRules.pdf' files contains all information relating to Codds rules questions.
